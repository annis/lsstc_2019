We propose to set up a mentoring laboratory for undergraduates to
learn data driven LSST science at the Center for Particle
Astrophysics at Fermilab.
Our plan is to enable a group of undergraduates to learn from
each other under the supervision of experienced cosmic
frontier scientists, a model that was shown to work
well last year. Many of these  undergraduates will
form the candidate graduate student classes in years to come.
