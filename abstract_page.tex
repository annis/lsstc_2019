We propose to set up a mentoring laboratory for undergraduates to
learn data and model driven LSST science at the Center for Particle
Astrophysics at Fermilab.
Fermilab has a long tradition of hosting undergraduate
interns in high energy physics and cosmology. 
We  propose to leverage off of this tradition by
bringing on three undergraduate interns from this funding
and several more from exisiting Fermilab intern programs
to form an intern group that will explore the science 
of combining DC2 science analysis with CosmoSIS modeling.
Our plan is to enable a group of undergraduates to learn from
each other under the supervision of experienced cosmic
frontier scientists, a model that was shown to work
well last year. Many of these  undergraduates will
form the candidate graduate student classes in years to come.
