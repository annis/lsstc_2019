We propose to develop and innovate our internship for undergraduates for Summer 2019 a the Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics.
Last year, interns participated in LSST science projects under the supervision of experience cosmic frontier scientists, while learning from each other as colleagues and teammates.
Interns were also introduced data science through ongoing activities at Fermilab, as well as a pilot program in science communication. 
This year, we plan to add to this by solidifying new modes of learning and interaction for the internships, including planned training in data science, best software development practices, and science ommunication.
These items will supplement the team-building research efforts that were piloted last year and worked successfully.
%learn data driven LSST science at the Center for Particle
%Astrophysics at Fermilab.
%Our plan is to enable a group of undergraduates to learn from
%each other under the supervision of experienced cosmic
%frontier scientists, a model that was shown to work
%well last year. Many of these  undergraduates will
%form the candidate graduate student classes in years to come.
