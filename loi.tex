\section{Letter of Intent}

Dear Enabling Science Committee:

We envision sending our four undergraduate interns to the two-day
undergraduate student program at the 2019 LSST Project \& Community Workshop
organized by the LSSTCorp. Last summer we proposed to send 2 students; in the end
deciding which 2 was too problematic, and we requested and received funding from
LSSTCorp to send all 5. The interns reported that this was a great event
for them; preparing the interns for the shotgun talks was one of the many
highlights of the summer. We found that this concrete event, with its poster session
and talk in front of scientists, focused their minds remarkably on what they had to
say. We would plan to send our 4 interns. It is unlikely they
can attend without LSSTCorp support; thus LSSTCorp support is of value to us and to the
interns and we would respond to a request for student travel funding.

Sincerely,
Brian Nord
