\subsection{Budget Narrative}


% Our budget is simple: it is all people.
% We propose to hire two summer interns, which 
% are costed at \$4,000 per 10 week session.
% We propose to hire a post-baccalaureate, which
%we cost at \$25,000 for 50 weeks, plus fringe benefits at 23.75\%,
% Robert Cararra's email says 1256 hours = 31.4 weeks
% we cost at \$23,845, plus fringe benefits at 29.75\%,
% giving \$30,938. 
%
% % The total funds requested is \$38,938.

We propose to hire a post-baccalaureate with partial support for 12 weeks, which we cost at \$2,200 
plus fringe benefits at 29.75\%, giving a total of \$2,800.  The remainder of the salary
support is from a laboratory directed research and development grant. 
We also propose to hire four summer interns for 10 weeks, which are costed at \$16,000 in total.  
We allocate out of state travel for one student, to bring them to the Lab and return them at the
end of summer, \$1,500. Fermilab interns who stay with the group at a local hotel have thier
shared rooms subsized at $\approx \$1.1$k per person, thus we ask for \$4,500 for housing support.
The total funds requested is \$27,719.



\subsection{Matching funds or cost sharing:}
The full accounting for indirect costs shows that Fermilab is contributing \$25,608 to this
project. Uncosted by very real is the support we recieve from the Fermilab intern programs.
